- This program can be run on a laptop. 
- It is fast to generate the data by running `local_current.m`
- After calculation, you'll get the data saved in a file named `local_current.mat`.
- For convinience, I've put a copy of the final result in this folder of which the name is `local_current.mat`. 
- To produce the Fig.3a in the original paper, just run the file `plot_figure3a.m`.
