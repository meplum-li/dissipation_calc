- This program can be executed on a laptop but with large RAM by running `main.m` directly.

- After calculation, you'll get the data saved in a file named `dissipation_data.mat`.
- For convinience, I've put a copy of the final result in this folder of which the name is `dissipation_data.mat`.
- To produce the Fig.3d in the original paper, just run the file `plot_figure3d.m`.
- The programs in this folder lack comments. If you need explanations for the programs, you can refer directly to the programs in the folder `../figure2b_figure4b`.
